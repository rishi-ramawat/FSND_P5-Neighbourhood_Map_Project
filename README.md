# Neighbourhood Map Project

A single page application featuring a map of a neighbourhood I would like to visit.
This map includes some highlighted locations, third-party data of those locations and various ways to browse the content.

**Note:** This is a solution to project 5 of the [Udacity Full-Stack Web Developer Nanodegree Program][1] based on the courses [Javascript Design Patterns (ud989)][4], [Intro to AJAX (ud110)][3] and [Google Maps APIs (ud864)][2].
